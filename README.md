# **MET CS601: Module 5 Assignment - Justin Yun**
This is a README.md - summary for Assignment 5 
https://jlyun9000.github.io/as5lasttest/
### I touched these files:

## App.js
Logo on the top, name of store ( Local Grocery Store ), list of items, and footer

## App.css
Design of the page: looks similar to the sample screenshot given in assignment pdf file.

## inventory.json
Inventory Data. Each data have five fields:  SKU, Name, Description, Quantity, Price

## InventoryItem.js
Component called InventorItem (Functional Componenets)

Requirement 4-c states to "Display only data for the SKU, Name, and Qty fields". However, the sample screenshot includes the price data. 

Therefore, I included the price data in the display just like the sample screenshot.


## InventoryList.js
Component called InventoryList (Class Componenets)
